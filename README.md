## 💼 About Pokémon Co. Ltd

At Pokémon Co. Ltd (definitely not the real one), we’re dedicated to crafting joyful, imaginative, and meaningful experiences — powered by front-end magic and back-end battle strategies.

Born from a love for Pokémon and web development, this parody project is a modern corporate profile site styled like a real tech company… if it were run by Team Rocket and developers.
